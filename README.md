# Scouting

The goal of this repository is to provide an open source tool for scouting teams at FIRST Robotics Competitions.

This project is built on a Gradle submodule structure, allowing for new tools to be produced and
added to the same repository, here.

Each submodule will have its own README.md file, which will be descriptive unto itself.

This project is a past-time passion project, until it becomes a more fully functional or vital part of any team,
whether 7125, or another, I do not intend to work on this full time.

That being said anyone is welcome to contribute, just hit me up with a pull request!

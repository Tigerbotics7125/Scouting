## What is this repo for?
The goal of this repository is to provide an open source tool for scouting teams at FIRST Robotics Competitions.

This project is built on a Gradle submodule structure, allowing for new tools to be produced and
added to the same repository, here.

This project is a past-time passion project, until it becomes a more fully functional or vital part of any team,
whether 7125, or another, I do not intend to work on this full time.
